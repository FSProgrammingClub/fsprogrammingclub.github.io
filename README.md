# fsprogrammingclub.github.io
Files added here becomes a real website at http://fsprogrammingclub.github.io.

If we get a domain name, we can make that the url for the website, but that costs a little bit of money (like around $10/yr).
Also, those don't have to be .com, there is also .club which could be cool. It could be something like fsprogramming.club or fscoding.club.
