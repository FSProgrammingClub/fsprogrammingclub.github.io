# fsprogrammingclub.github.io
Files added here becomes a real website at http://fsprogrammingclub.github.io.

We could also get a domain name, but those cost a little bit of money to own (like around $10/yr). Also, it doesn't have to be .com, there is also .club which could be cool (because we are technically a club and not a company). It could be something like fsprogramming.club or fscoding.club.
